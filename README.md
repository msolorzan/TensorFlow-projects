### [01_neural_network_regression_in_tensorflow.ipynb](01_neural_network_regression_in_tensorflow.ipynb)
## Fundamentals of NN

* Understanding overall a Neural Networks works and using TensorFlow library. 
* Understanding the concepts of loss, metrics, optimizer, dense, sequential, etc.
* Setting up my first NN.
* Using different model to improve performance, until reaching the best MAE metrics value
* I did it a NN linear regressor
* I used the [insurance data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/master/insurance.csv) to prove his capacity
